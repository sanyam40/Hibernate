# Hibernate

Hibernate is an open-source, Java-based framework that provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution. ORM is a programming technique that allows you to interact with relational databases using object-oriented programming concepts. In simpler terms, Hibernate bridges the gap between your Java code and a relational database, making it easier to work with database data using Java objects.
